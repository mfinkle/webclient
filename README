webclient - Web access to a ZNC server

Initially based on the webclient module by Ted Mielczarek found here:
https://github.com/luser/znc

Ted adds a ZNC module (webclient) which allows a web app to communicate with ZNC 
using server-side events. Some of the differences between this code and Ted's:
* I wanted to work with the ZNC that installs on Ubuntu 12.04. Ted's code works
  with ZNC trunk. I had to remove support for features not in the Ubuntu version.
* Server-side events uses a request header ("Last-Event-ID"), but ZNC has no
  support for getting access to request headers. Ted added support in his fork.
  I wanted to work from a shipping version of ZNC, so I use a cookie instead of
  a header.
* I wanted to build a mobile webapp, not a desktop webapp. The web code is based
  on jQuery Mobile.
